#### Managing a Network ACL

    An AWS Network Access Control List (NACL) works as a firewall at the VPC level for 
    controlling incoming and outgoing requests from one or more subnets associated 
    with that VPC. It is used in conjunction with the 
    in controlling traffic to the AWS. When we create a VPC, a
     default NACL is created that is open to every IP and port. T
     he subnet is associated with the default NACL created during its creation. 
     We can create a custom NACL and associate it with a subnet,
      thus replacing the default NACL.
      
#####Managing a Security Group
     Security Group (SG) works as a virtual firewall that controls incoming traffic
      to protect resources hosted in AWS, such as EC2 and RDS, from unwanted access.
       The same SGs should be associated with services/resources having the same 
       functionality and security requirements such as a cluster of web servers. 
       SGs can span across different subnets in a VPC. SGs are stateful firewall
       s where you can define rules for a valid source, protocol, and port for 
       incoming and outgoing traffic. Stateful meaning--if the connection 
       from source to destination is allowed, the return path is also allowed.
        At least one SG needs to be attached to the resource at the time of
         resource creation. More than one SG can also be attached to a resource. 
         The rules of an SG can be modified at any time and they will take effect 
         
         immediately. An SG can be detached from the resource at any time.
    

#### Managing a Route Table

    A Route Table contains a set of rules that control how the network t
    raffic flows within a VPC and outside of it. Each subnet must be 
    associated with one Route Table. However, Route Tables may contain 
    more than one subnet that needs the same route configuration.
